# PredictFutureSales

This project predicts the future sale of products sold at various shops by relying on previous years data. I used machine learning models as well as tensorflow to calculate the MAE of the price of these future products sold.

The data for this project was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/overview. I hypertuned Random Forest to improve the accuracy. 

I also used Tensorflow to calculate the accuracy in predicting future sales.
